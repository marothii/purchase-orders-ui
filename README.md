  - Itemized list of ordered products, including SKU, quantity, unit price, and total amount.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structural framework of the application.
- **CSS**: Responsible for styling and ensuring an aesthetically pleasing layout.
- **JavaScript**: Facilitates dynamic interactions and populates order data.
- **JSON**: Simulates backend data for purchase orders.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure that all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are located within the same directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the application.

## How to Use the Application

## Relation to Professional Experience

This project showcases my skills in web development, aligning closely with my previous experience in creating interactive web applications. For instance, in my role at [Your Previous Company/Project Name], I developed similar functionalities where I [briefly describe your responsibilities or the project, e.g., "implemented a real-time order management system that improved tracking efficiency by 30%"]. 

This experience has strengthened my proficiency in front-end technologies, enhancing my ability to design intuitive user interfaces and manage dynamic data interactions.

## Conclusion

The Purchase Orders Management Web Application serves as a testament to my capabilities in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It reflects my commitment to building user-friendly web applications and sets the foundation for future projects that may involve backend integration and full-stack development.
