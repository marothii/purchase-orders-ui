# Purchase Orders Management Web Application

## Project Overview

The **Purchase Orders Management Web Application** is a user-friendly interface designed to manage and display purchase orders efficiently. Users can view a list of their purchase orders and access detailed information about each order in a modal window, making it easy to keep track of their order statuses and contents.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Order Listing**: Displays a list of all purchase orders with their status.
- **Detailed Order Modal**: Clicking on an order reveals a modal containing:
  - Order Address
  - Contact Person
  - Order Status
  - Itemized list of ordered products, including SKU, quantity, unit price, and total amount.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structural framework of the application.
- **CSS**: Responsible for styling and ensuring an aesthetically pleasing layout.
- **JavaScript**: Facilitates dynamic interactions and populates order data.
- **JSON**: Simulates backend data for purchase orders.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure that all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are located within the same directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the application.

## How to Use the Application

1. Launch the application by opening `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Click on any purchase order in the list to view its details in a modal dialog.
3. Close the modal by clicking the 'X' in the upper right corner or clicking outside the modal area.
### Relation to Previous Experience

This project builds on my experience both in my role at Limelight and a previous group project creating an online bookstore. At Limelight, I implemented dynamic order management features that improved tracking efficiency, deepening my knowledge of responsive design and real-time data handling. In the online bookstore project, I developed an intuitive user interface and handled data interactions for inventory management, strengthening my proficiency in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Conclusion

Combining insights from my professional role and project work, this application demonstrates my ability to build user-friendly, data-driven web solutions. These experiences continue to shape my focus on creating streamlined and efficient interfaces in future projects.

The Purchase Orders Management Web Application serves as a testament to my capabilities in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It reflects my commitment to building user-friendly web applications and sets the foundation for future projects that may involve backend integration and full-stack development.
